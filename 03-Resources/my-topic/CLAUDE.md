# my-topic Wiki Schema

## Directory Layout
- raw/              -- immutable source drops. Never edit files here.
- raw/articles/     -- text source documents (articles, papers, transcripts).
- raw/attachments/  -- images and binary attachments.
- wiki/             -- LLM-owned pages. You have full write access here.
- wiki/index.md     -- catalog. Read this FIRST before opening any other page.
- wiki/queries/     -- filed query answers. Promote to wiki/ when durable.
- outputs/reports/  -- dated lint reports and other artifacts.
- log.md            -- append-only operation log. Never edit existing entries.

### query-output.md
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [domain]
type: query-output
question: "<original question>"
status: filed
---
# <Question as title>
<synthesized answer>

## Sources
- [[page-1]]
- [[page-2]]

## Naming Conventions
- All filenames: lowercase-kebab-case.md
- Wikilinks: [[filename-without-extension]]
- Never use standard markdown links for internal links

## Log Format
Append to log.md after every operation. Format:
  ## [YYYY-MM-DD] <operation> | <title>
  <one-line description>

Operations: ingest | compile | query | lint | promote | remove

## Index Format
wiki/index.md is a human- and LLM-readable catalog. Format:
  ## Domain Name
  - [[page-name]] -- one-line description (YYYY-MM-DD)

Keep entries under 80 chars. Update after every ingest.

## Cross-Reference Rules
- Every page must link to at least one other page when content warrants it
- When creating or updating a concept page, scan index.md for related entities and add [[wikilinks]]
- Flag contradictions inline: > [!WARNING] Contradiction with [[other-page]]

## Ingest Rules
1. Acquire the source (URL or file)
2. Classify the source type
3. Save to raw/articles/ with frontmatter (compiled: false)
4. Append to log.md
5. Commit
Ingest does NOT create wiki pages. Use compile for that.

## Compile Rules
1. Identify uncompiled raw sources (no matching source-summary in wiki/)
2. For each source: write source-summary, extract entities, create/update pages
3. Backlink audit: grep existing pages for mentions of new titles
4. Update wiki/index.md
5. Append to log.md
6. Commit
One source typically touches 5-15 pages. This is normal.

## Query Rules
1. Read wiki/index.md first
2. Open relevant pages
3. Synthesize answer with [[wikilinks]] as citations
4. Always file answer to wiki/queries/ (mandatory, no prompt)
5. Offer promotion to wiki/ as a concept page (y/n)
6. Append to log.md (both query and optional promote events)
7. Commit changes

## Lint Rules
Scan all pages in wiki/ and report:
- Contradictions between pages
- Orphan pages (no inbound [[links]])
- Pages with status: stale older than 90 days
- Missing Counter-Arguments and Gaps section
- Index entries pointing to missing files
After fixing, append to log.md and commit.
